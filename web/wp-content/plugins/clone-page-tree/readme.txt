Adds a "Clone Page Tree" action to the page row actions to duplicate an entire page hierarchy.

== Description ==

Adds a "Clone Page Tree" action to the page row actions.  Cloning a page tree clones the page and all descendents creating a new copy of the full hierarchy.  After clicking "Clone Page Tree" you will be redirected to edit the top-most page to allow you to give it a unique title.  All cloned pages are left in draft mode.

There are [many plugins out there](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/duplicate/) which allow you to duplicate a post or page however this is the only one that allows you to duplicate a page and all its descendent pages in a single click.

Code is stored in this [github repo](https://github.com/cncf/clone-page-tree).
