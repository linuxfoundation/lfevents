## Advanced Usage

Managing WordPress content via blocks becomes easier when you know the tips & tricks. You can find more on our [blog](https://conditionalblocks.com/blog/).

### Draft content on live pages

Use the Lockdown condition to create draft blocks inside live content, and simply remove the condition when you're ready to publish. You don't have to worry about people seeing the content before it's complete. Using the Lockdown Condition eliminates need to create a separate draft page.

### Apply Conditions to Groups

One of our favorite methods of managing WordPress content is to use Group Blocks. If you setup a Group Blocks you can set conditions directly the Group, this means that all nested blocks inside the Group will automatically follow the same visibility conditions.

### Design Patterns

Yes it‚Äôs also possible to pre-make dynamic templates using Conditional Blocks. You‚Äôll have to make use of the WordPress Design Patterns. Simply make a patterns as you‚Äôve also done while applying the visibility rules. 

The patterns will be ready and be conditionally displayed when you insert it on a page. We personally use the same method on Synced Patterns too. (Previously known as Reusable Blocks in Gutenberg).

## Restrictive content made easy

Control access to any block by clicking on it within the Block Editor and using the Condition Builder to add visibility rules. Perfect for members-only content.

## Responsive designs simplified

Effortlessly adapt your blocks for mobile, tablet, or desktop display, automatically showing or hiding content according to screen sizes.
